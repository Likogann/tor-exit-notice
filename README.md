# Updated Tor Exit Notice
An updated "tor-exit-notice.html" that contains the same information as the old one, just on a nicer web page.
## Installation
Download the git repository. <b>This uses CSS and Fonts like a regular website. You may have to use software like NGINX or Apache2 to host your webserver!

### NGINX / Apache2
[NGINX Static Web Directory](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/serving-static-content/)
[Serving a static web page using Apache](https://github.com/KBNLresearch/nl-menu-resources/blob/master/doc/serving-static-website-with-Apache.md)

### Modifying the Page
There's only the "index.html" page so it's fairly simple to modify.
Make sure you change the abuse emails - <i>I don't want  your abuse reports!</i>

Optionally, you can also modify the footer to add other contacts. I have my github as a link as an example. You can safely change these.

## Credit
While credit is greatly apreciated, I really made this website using [w3school's web tempates](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp). The real credit goes to w3schools.
You can remove any links to me, this includes emails, links, and copyright messages.

If  you really want to credit me though, you can keep my github in there.
